# Briscola Game

Briscola is a card game re-creation! Play the game online [here](#).

## Gameplay

It is played with 2 or 4 players using a 40-card deck, and usually, players compete in pairs. Each game consists of three hands, and the winner of each hand is the first to exceed 60 points. The card points are as follows:

Ace = 11
Three = 10
King = 4
Horse = 3
Infantry = 2
The other cards do not score points. The dealer deals three cards to each player and then reveals one card, which remains uncovered under the deck and determines the trump suit. The game begins with the player to the right of the dealer playing a card.

Subsequent players take turns playing a card, and the winner of each round is either the player with the highest card of the same suit as the first card played or the highest trump card. (Trump cards are called "briscola" â€“ all cards with the trump suit.)

Responding is not mandatory, and during the first round, players cannot communicate or make signs with their teammates. After the first round, before playing a card, players must draw a card, starting with the winner of the previous round. On the last hand, after drawing, players in pairs can reveal their cards and calculate the points already earned.
